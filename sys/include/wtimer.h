/**
 * @defgroup  sys_wtimer System Timer
 * @ingroup   sys
 * @brief     Provides a high level abstraction timer module to register
 *            timers, get current system time, and let a thread sleep for
 *            a certain amount of time.
 *
 * The implementation takes one low-level timer that is supposed to run at 1MHz
 * speed and multiplexes it. It can deal with low-level timers with less than
 * 32bit width.
 *
 * Insertion and removal of timers has O(n) complexity with (n) being the
 * number of active timers.  The reason for this is that multiplexing is
 * realized by next-first singly linked lists.
